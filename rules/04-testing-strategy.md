# Testing Strategy Directives

## Scope
REQUIRED: Apply these testing standards to all testing activities across all programming languages, frameworks, and project types.

## Absolute-Prohibitions
PROHIBITED: Write tests that check implementation details instead of behavior
PROHIBITED: Commit tests without proper cleanup of test data
PROHIBITED: Use production databases or external services in unit tests
PROHIBITED: Ignore test coverage requirements for critical paths

## Communication-Protocol
REQUIRED: Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
REQUIRED: Write tests only when explicitly required or code is production-ready
REQUIRED: Use descriptive test names that explain scenarios
REQUIRED: Test edge cases and error conditions thoroughly

## Structural-Rules

### Testing Philosophy
REQUIRED: Write tests only when explicitly required or when code reaches production-ready state
REQUIRED: Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details

### Hybrid Testing Approach
REQUIRED: Use RGR (Red-Green-Refactor) for clear requirements:
1. Red: Write failing test
2. Green: Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor: Clean up while tests pass
REQUIRED: Use implementation-first approach for unclear/exploratory requirements
REQUIRED: Add tests after stabilization for exploratory code

### Test Organization
REQUIRED: Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
REQUIRED: Group related tests logically by feature or functionality
REQUIRED: Keep test data minimal and focused on the test case
Consider Mock external dependencies appropriately
REQUIRED: Categorize tests as:
1. Unit Tests: Test individual functions and components in isolation
2. Integration Tests: Test interactions between components
3. End-to-End Tests: Test complete user workflows
4. Performance Tests: Test system performance under load

### Test File Structure
REQUIRED: Use standardized test directory structure:
```
tests/
├── unit/                   # Unit tests
│   ├── test_models.py
│   ├── test_services.py
│   └── test_utils.py
├── integration/            # Integration tests
│   ├── test_api.py
│   └── test_database.py
├── fixtures/              # Test data and fixtures
└── conftest.py            # Test configuration
```

## Language-Rules

### Python Testing Pytest
REQUIRED: Use pytest as the primary testing framework
REQUIRED: Implement pytest-cov for code coverage tracking
REQUIRED: Use pytest-mock for proper test isolation
REQUIRED: Create reusable fixtures for common test setup
REQUIRED: Use descriptive test names following this pattern:
```python
def test_user_creation_with_valid_data_returns_user_object():
    # Test implementation

def test_user_creation_with_invalid_email_raises_validation_error():
    # Test implementation

# Fixtures for common setup
@pytest.fixture
def sample_user_data():
    return {
        "username": "testuser",
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "password": "securepassword"
    }
```

### Go Testing
REQUIRED: Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
REQUIRED: Focus on integration tests for database and API endpoints
REQUIRED: Ensure test coverage for all exported functions
REQUIRED: Test error handling paths and edge cases
REQUIRED: Follow Go test patterns:
```go
func TestUserService(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name    string
        input   User
        want    error
        wantErr bool
    }{
        {
            name: "valid user creation",
            input: User{Name: "John", Email: "john@example.com"},
            want: nil,
            wantErr: false,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
