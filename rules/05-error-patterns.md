### Language Specific Patterns

#### Python Error Handling

REQUIRED: Follow Python error handling patterns:
```python
# Custom exception classes
class ValidationError(Exception):
    """Raised when input validation fails"""
    pass

class DatabaseError(Exception):
    """Raised when database operation fails"""
    pass

# Comprehensive error handling
def process_user_data(user_data):
    try:
        # Validate input
        if not user_data.get('email'):
            raise ValidationError("Email is required")

        # Process data
        result = save_to_database(user_data)
        return result

    except ValidationError as e:
        logger.error(f"Validation failed: {e}")
        raise
    except DatabaseError as e:
        logger.error(f"Database error: {e}")
        # Implement retry logic or fallback
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
        raise RuntimeError("Processing failed") from e
```

#### Go Error Handling

REQUIRED: Follow Go error handling patterns:
```go
// Custom error types
type ValidationError struct {
    Field   string
    Message string
}

func (e *ValidationError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("validation error for %s: %s", e.Field, e.Message)
}

// Comprehensive error handling
func ProcessUserData(userData map[string]interface{}) error {
    // Validate input
    if email, ok := userData["email"]; !ok || email == "" {
        return &ValidationError{Field: "email", Message: "email is required"}
    }

    // Process data
    result, err := saveToDatabase(userData)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("database error: %w", err)
    }

    return nil
}
```

#### Shell Script Error Handling

REQUIRED: Follow shell script error handling patterns:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Enable strict mode
set -euo pipefail

# Error handler with context
handle_error() {
    local exit_code=$?
    local line_number=$1
    echo "ERROR: Script failed on line $line_number with exit code $exit_code" >&2
    exit $exit_code
}

# Set up error trap
trap 'handle_error $LINENO' ERR

# Input validation
validate_input() {
    local input="$1"
    if [[ -z "$input" ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Input parameter is required" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

## Language Rules

    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN

    def call(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise Exception("Circuit breaker is OPEN")

        try:
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            if self.state == "HALF_OPEN":
                self.state = "CLOSED"
                self.failure_count = 0
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self.failure_count += 1
            self.last_failure_time = time.time()

            if self.failure_count >= self.failure_threshold:
                self.state = "OPEN"
