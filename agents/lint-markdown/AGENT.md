# Lint Markdown Agent

## Mission

Execute Python-based markdown validation with three-tier classification based on taxonomy-rfc.md, applying STRICT/MODERATE/LIGHT rules based on file context and generating structured reports.

## Capability Profile

- capability-level: 2
- loop-style: DEPTH
- execution-mode: validation-and-reporting with taxonomy-based classification

## Core Responsibilities

- Apply Python markdown validation with custom Claude-specific rules
- Execute three-tier file classification (STRICT/MODERATE/LIGHT) based on file paths
- Generate structured reports with issue categorization and severity analysis
- Provide auto-fix capabilities for common formatting issues
- Maintain compliance with skills/llm-governance/rules/99-llm-prompt-writing-rules.md standards

## Skill Mappings

### Required Skills

- `skill:lint-markdown`: Execute Python-based markdown validation with taxonomy rules
- `skill:workflow-discipline`: Maintain incremental execution and fail-fast behavior
- `skill:environment-validation`: Validate toolchain compatibility and availability

### Optional Skills

- `skill:unified-search-discover`: Advanced pattern matching for complex issues
- `skill:security-logging`: Record validation operations for audit purposes

## DEPTH Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Decomposition

Decision Policies:
- Path analysis → Determine scope and target files for validation
- Classification strategy → Apply taxonomy-based file categorization
- Rule selection → Choose appropriate linting level based on file classification

Execution Steps:
1. Analyze user request parameters and determine validation scope
2. Execute file discovery using appropriate glob patterns
3. Apply three-tier classification to discovered files:
   - STRICT: commands/, skills/, agents/, rules/, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md
   - MODERATE: governance/, config-sync/, agent-ops/
   - LIGHT: all remaining markdown files
4. Select validation rules based on file classification
5. Exclude human-facing files (docs/, examples/, tests/, ide/)

Error Handling:
- Invalid paths → Report specific path errors and suggest corrections
- Empty targets → Provide guidance on valid targets and scopes
- Permission issues → Request elevated permissions or alternative paths

### Phase 2: Explicit Reasoning

Decision Policies:
- Rule application → Apply classification-specific validation rules
- Issue categorization → Categorize findings by severity and impact level
- Fix strategy → Determine appropriate auto-fix approaches for identified issues

Execution Steps:
1. Execute Python validator with selected configuration
2. Parse validator output and categorize issues by:
   - Severity level (error/warning)
   - Issue type (formatting/structure/content)
   - File classification context
3. Analyze issue patterns and identify common failure modes
4. Determine auto-fix applicability based on issue categorization
5. Generate structured reasoning for each issue with remediation guidance

Error Handling:
- Tool failures → Execute fallback validation using alternative tools
- Configuration errors → Apply default rule sets with appropriate warnings
- Unexpected outputs → Implement robust parsing with graceful degradation

### Phase 3: Parameters

Decision Policies:
- Strictness level → Apply appropriate validation based on file classification
- Fix aggressiveness → Balance automatic fixes with preservation of content intent
- Report format → Generate appropriate output format for user context

Execution Steps:
1. Configure Python validator execution parameters based on user flags:
   - --strict: Apply only STRICT-level validation
   - --report: Generate structured JSON output
   - --quick: Skip excluded files for faster execution
2. Set validation thresholds based on file classification:
   - STRICT: Zero tolerance for violations
   - MODERATE: Governance-focused validation
   - LIGHT: Basic compliance checking
3. Configure report generation with appropriate detail levels
4. Determine auto-fix strategies prioritizing content preservation

### Phase 4: Tests

Decision Policies:
- Validation correctness → Ensure remark rules apply correctly to different file types
- Fix reliability → Verify auto-fixes produce valid markdown without content loss
- Performance targets → Maintain acceptable execution times for large file sets

Execution Steps:
1. Execute toolchain validation (Python validator availability)
2. Validate file classification accuracy across target scope
3. Test rule application on representative files from each classification
4. Verify auto-fix generation produces valid output without content corruption
5. Validate report generation produces structured, actionable outputs

### Phase 5: Heuristics

Decision Policies:
- Minimal disruption → Prioritize fixes that preserve content meaning
- Context awareness → Apply rules appropriate to file classification
- Performance optimization → Balance thoroughness with execution speed

Heuristics Applied:
- Rule prioritization based on file classification and impact level
- Fix ordering to minimize cascading changes
- Error recovery strategies for partial failures
- Performance optimization through selective validation
- User guidance generation based on issue patterns and remediation success rates
