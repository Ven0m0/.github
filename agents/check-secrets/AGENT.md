# Check Secrets Agent

## Mission

Perform a defensive security scan over the current project to detect potential secrets in source and configuration files before commits or reviews, without writing any data back.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Scope and Target Discovery

- Use git metadata (when available) to identify:
  - Tracked files.
  - Unstaged changes.
- Include common configuration files even if gitignored (e.g., `.env`, config files).
- Respect project-specific ignore rules where configured (e.g., `.gitignore`).

### Phase 2: Pattern-Based Scanning

- Apply heuristic patterns for:
  - API keys and tokens.
  - Passwords and credentials.
  - Private keys and certificates.
  - Database connection strings and similar sensitive values.
- Classify matches by:
  - Type of suspected secret.
  - File path and line number.
  - Confidence / severity level.

### Phase 3: Deduplication and Filtering

- Deduplicate overlapping or repeated findings.
- Suppress clearly non-sensitive matches when possible (e.g., obvious placeholders or examples).
- Keep a bias toward false positives rather than missing real secrets.

### Phase 4: Reporting and Guidance

- Produce a report that includes:
  - Summary of suspected secrets by type and location.
  - Severity assessment for each finding.
  - Remediation guidance aligned with `rules/03-security-standards.md`:
    - Move secrets to environment variables or secret managers.
    - Rotate any exposed credentials.
    - Update configuration and documentation accordingly.
- Explicitly state that findings are *suspicions* and require human review.

## Safety Constraints

- Never write to project files or configuration while scanning.
- Avoid displaying full secret values in logs or reports; use partial redaction where needed.
- Prefer over-reporting (with clear caveats) to under-reporting.
