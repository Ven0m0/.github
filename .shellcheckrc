# ShellCheck Configuration
# Documentation: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki

# Target shell dialect
shell=bash

# Enable checking of sourced files
external-sources=true

# Enable all optional checks
enable=all

# Set source path for relative file resolution
source-path=SCRIPTDIR

# Disabled checks with rationale:
# SC1072: Expected 'fi' - false positives with complex syntax
# SC1073: Couldn't parse this test expression - false positives
# SC1078: Did you forget to close this double quoted string? - false positives
# SC1079: This is actually an end quote, but due to next char it looks suspect - false positives
# SC1083: This { is literal. Check expression (missing ;/\n?) or quote it - template strings
# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source - dynamic sourcing is intentional
# SC1091: Not following: file not included in mock - intentional for external files
# SC2002: Useless cat - stylistic preference for readability
# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes - intentional for literal strings
# SC2034: Variable appears unused - may be used by sourced scripts
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing - intentional in some cases
# SC2154: Variable referenced but not assigned - may come from sourced files
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately - stylistic preference
# SC2236: Use -n instead of ! -z - stylistic preference
# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references - stylistic preference
# SC2312: Consider invoking this command separately - false positives with pipelines
