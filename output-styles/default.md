# Default Output Style

- Follow all safety, correctness, and structural requirements from `rules/98-communication-protocol.md`.
- Prefer terse, directive, high-density responses while still providing all information needed for correct implementation.
- Assume the reader is a professional developer; avoid oversimplification but do not add unnecessary narrative.
- Default to TERSE-mode communication patterns; expand detail only when:
  - The task inherently requires more context, or
  - The user explicitly triggers explanatory behavior (for example, “explain more”, “详细说明”).
