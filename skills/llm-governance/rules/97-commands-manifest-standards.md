# Command Manifest Standards

## scope
REQUIRED: Apply these standards to all command specification files under `.claude/commands/**/*.md` except README files.

## absolute-prohibitions
PROHIBITED: Omit required frontmatter fields for command manifests
PROHIBITED: Use inconsistent field names for core command manifest properties
PROHIBITED: Define command semantics only in narrative body text without structured sections

## communication-protocol
REQUIRED: Use terse, directive statements for command usage and workflow definitions
REQUIRED: Describe arguments, workflow, and output explicitly
REQUIRED: Avoid narrative walkthroughs; prefer canonical command specs

## structural-rules

### command-manifest-frontmatter
REQUIRED: Use YAML frontmatter starting and ending with `---` markers
REQUIRED frontmatter keys:
- name
- description
- argument-hint
- allowed-tools
OPTIONAL frontmatter key:
- is_background (boolean, default: false)
OPTIONAL frontmatter key:
- style (string or list of strings describing prompt style, for example reasoning-first, tool-first, minimal-chat)

REQUIRED frontmatter types:
- name: string
- description: string
- argument-hint: string
- allowed-tools: list
- is_background: boolean when present
 - style: string or list when present

PREFERRED frontmatter key order:
1. name
2. description
3. argument-hint
4. allowed-tools
5. is_background
6. style

### command-body-structure
REQUIRED: Provide body sections describing:
- Usage
- Arguments
- Workflow
- Output

REQUIRED: Use these section headings with stable spelling and title case
OPTIONAL: Add extra sections such as Examples, Safety, Error Handling after the core sections
REQUIRED: Keep instruction sequences deterministic and tool-safe

## language-rules
REQUIRED: Use imperative sentences for workflow steps and output descriptions
REQUIRED: Describe arguments and their types precisely
PROHIBITED: Narrative prose that does not read as command documentation

## formatting-rules
REQUIRED: Plain markdown with code fences only for literal examples and command snippets
PROHIBITED: Markdown bold markers in body content
REQUIRED: Lowercase kebab-case filename `97-commands-manifest-standards.md`

## naming-rules
REQUIRED: Use `name` as the canonical identifier key for commands
REQUIRED: Use semantic, lowercase names that match routing or slash-command identifiers
REQUIRED: Use `style` only as a label referencing documented style guides when present

## validation-rules

### manifest-completeness
REQUIRED: Validate presence of required frontmatter keys for all governed command files
REQUIRED: Flag missing or incorrectly typed fields as critical errors

### structure-alignment
REQUIRED: Ensure core sections Usage, Arguments, Workflow, Output are present
REQUIRED: Flag missing or renamed core sections as violations

## narrative-detection
REQUIRED: Treat multi-paragraph narrative in command specs as violations unless explicitly marked as examples
PROHIBITED: Conversational guidance that does not describe concrete command behavior

## depth-compatibility
REQUIRED: Keep command manifest schema stable enough for deterministic parsing and rewrite tools
REQUIRED: Express all parameters and behaviors through frontmatter and structured sections so tools can derive usage and workflows
REQUIRED: Place custom metadata fields (is_background, style) in metadata section, not top-level
REQUIRED: Refer to `skills/llm-governance/rules/96-metadata-standards.md` for complete metadata field placement and validation rules
